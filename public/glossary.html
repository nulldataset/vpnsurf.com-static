Remember that privacy is layered—pair VPN use with browser hygiene (separate profiles, limited extensions, and updated software).

For business users, clear policy and least-privilege access reduce risk more than ‘always route everything everywhere.’ When in doubt, prefer simpler configurations: fewer exceptions, fewer custom routes, and verified leak-test results. Elite VPN setups focus on reliability: stable reconnects, clean DNS handling, and a proven kill- switch behavior.

If you travel often, this term becomes especially important because airports, hotels, and cafes are common interception points. A practical tip is to verify behavior after OS updates, since networking defaults and DNS behavior can change unexpectedly.
